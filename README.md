## Description 
For the first function , It takes a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For instance, if the input string is 'The Quick Brown Fox', the output will be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'. It means that lowercase characters will be converted to uppercase and vice versa.

For the second function , It accepts two numbers as input and generates an array containing all the integers between them, inclusive of both numbers. For instance, if the input is 4 and 7, the output will be [4, 5, 6, 7], and if the input is -4 and 7, the output will be [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

For the last Javascript function ,It takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. It efficiently identifies prime numbers and ensures that they are returned in the same order they appear in the input array.
